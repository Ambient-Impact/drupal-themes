This respository contains a Drupal base theme intended to be used across
multiple sites (```ambientimpact_base```) and the theme used on
[ambientimpact.com](https://ambientimpact.com/) (```ambientimpact_site```).

Note that these depend on the
[```ambientimpact_core```](https://gitlab.com/Ambient.Impact/drupal-modules)
module being present and enabled to function, but [Drupal themes can't yet
declare modules as dependencies](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/474684).

**Warning**: while these are generally production-ready, they're not guaranteed
to maintain a stable API and may occasionally contain bugs, being a
work-in-progress. Stable releases may be provided at a later date.
