  // Note that we have to use 'flex-end' rather than 'end' as Chromium does not
  // yet seem to support the latter on flex containers yet.

  // @todo Can this be made configurable via some sort of JavaScript control
  //   that swaps to left-aligned? One idea is to have a small button in on the
  //   opposite side with an arrow icon pointing in that direction and a tooltip
  //   that indicates it would change the alignment.

  // Override the default align-items: stretch, as that'll cause buttons to
  // potentially enlarge vertically.
